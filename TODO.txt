Things to do for the web/mobile apps later

Update sepflag to next available number on website from data sent by mobile app (to account for sepflagid data loss on phone/multiple users)
Update 'fudge factor' for location coordinates in SetRoute method to allow for a radius to be set around a coordinate in meters.
